# Speech_Emotion_RecognitionSpeech Emotion Recognition (SER) using MFCC and LSTM
This project focuses on predicting emotions from audio data by extracting 
Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features and using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for classification.

# Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) identifies emotional tones from spoken audio data. 
This project uses MFCC for feature extraction and an LSTM model for analyzing temporal features in the audio data. 
It classifies speech into predefined emotion categories, making it suitable for research in emotion recognition and further application development.

# Features
- MFCC-Based Feature Extraction: Uses MFCC to convert audio signals into features that represent phonetic and emotional characteristics.
- LSTM Model for Sequence Learning: Employs an LSTM network to capture temporal dependencies in audio features.
- Emotion Classification: Supports classification into emotions such as [insert emotion classes here, e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral].
  
# Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- [Libraries: numpy, librosa, tensorflow or pytorch, matplotlib]
- VS Code or Jupyter Notebook
